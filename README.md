1. **Media Share Links**: Share links are URLs that, when clicked, open the respective social media platform's sharing interface with pre-filled content such as URLs, text, and images. They enable users to easily share content on various social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and more.

2. **ANSI Colors**: ANSI color codes are a set of standardized codes used to represent colors in text-based interfaces, particularly in command-line environments. They consist of numeric codes that correspond to specific colors, allowing developers to add color to text output in terminal applications for better readability and visual appeal.

3. **Screen Standard Resolutions**: Screen standard resolutions refer to the commonly used resolutions for display screens, including computer monitors, laptops, TVs, and mobile devices. Examples of standard resolutions include Full HD (1920x1080 pixels), 4K Ultra HD (3840x2160 pixels), and HD Ready (1280x720 pixels). These resolutions define the number of pixels displayed on the screen horizontally and vertically, impacting image clarity and detail.
